# Tuc-Chess
Project developed for Artificial Intelligence course. Variation of classic chess which is based on points. The base enviroment and the graphics 
were provided and we had to work on our agent. Our agent implements a simple version of minimax. The decision was made based on the fact that
after every move the is a possibility of a random present worth 1 point to appear at a random empty spot at the board. Our agent aim to first 
creeple the enemy, by capturing his pawns and then gather as many points as he can.
